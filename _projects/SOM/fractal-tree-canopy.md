This grasshopper definition generates a canopy structure through a recursive fractal pattern script.

First I generated a 2D fractal pattern using a recursive C# script component shown the the video below.

Here's a video showing only the endpoints of the fractal pattern.

Next I applied the pattern to a curved surface to generate the full 3D canopy model. The videos below show the results of varying the branch length and branch angle.
