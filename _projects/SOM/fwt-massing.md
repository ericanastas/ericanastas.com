I created this grasshopper definition while working with the team creating massing studies of the Fuzhou Worldwide Tower project.

## Study 1

This definition panalizes a provided BRep form into rectangular panels which are then rotated into various angled positions.

## Study 2

This definition takes a base BRep that defines the overall building form and generates a louver/fin system as shown in the attached video.
