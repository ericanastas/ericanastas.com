As part of preparation for a project interview presentation with Chevron, I developed this Revit model of one of their offices to showcase how SOM's use of BIM could benefit their project. I used the model to generate sample renderings and plan drawings, as well as schedules of program area and furniture quantities. A PDF of these drawings and schedules can be downloaded [here](/images/som/chevron-interview-model/Cheveron-Interview-Mock-Up-sr3.pdf).

I also exported this model to Ecotect to show how the it could be used for lighting and daylight analysis.
