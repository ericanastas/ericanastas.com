I developed this custom Grasshopper component that is able to calculate the position of the sun in the sky for a given day, time, and position on the earth. The component works by using the same formulas used by the [NOAA Solar Position Calculator](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/azel.html). The video below shows a simple shading study example created using this custom component.

The videos below show another example of the component being used to analyze the shading of existing buildings.
