I provided training and on the job Revit support to the team working on the design of this 55 story office tower. I also created some of the more complex custom families used on the project. In addition, I was the primary person responsible for creating the [enclosure model](http://www.ericanastas.com/fwt-enclosure/ "Timeline") using the new adaptive curtain panels.
