I provided training and on the job Revit support to the team working on the design of this 55 story office tower. I also created some of the more complex custom families used on the project. In addition, I was the primary person responsible for creating the [enclosure model](/projects/som/fwt-enclosure/) using the new adaptive curtain panels.
