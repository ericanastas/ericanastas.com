I created this Grasshopper definition for a project where the ratio of glazing to building facade that could be visible from various vantage points was restricted. The definition takes two collections of surfaces that represent glazed facade and unglazed facade. These surfaces are then projected to a vertical planed defined by two user controllable points, and the resulting area ratios are calculated and reported back to the user.
