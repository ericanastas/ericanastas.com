This was a side consulting project I worked on in my spare time. The primary architect working on the design of this remodel project was just starting out with Revit. I provided them with introductory training for the software. I also created the intial model of the existing structure from scanned copies of the original blue prints. After handing this model off to the architect I continued to provided additional support as they learned to use Revit.
