I worked with the team designing this 45 story office tower in Sichuan China providing training and support for Revit. I was also responsible for developing some of the more advanced families used by the project. In addition, I developed custom scripts using the Revit API to [automatically generate the project's enclosure model](http://www.ericanastas.com/sap-enclosure/).
