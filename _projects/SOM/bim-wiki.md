I have been a major contributor and supporter of the SOM BIM Wiki site. The BIM Wiki is an internal intranet site used to document the standards and best practices used by the firm in implementing the use of Revit and BIM.

In addition to providing content, I have also developed scripts for the site to automate the organization and generation of said content. This included a script which displayed Revit families from the firm's BIM library on pages of the site.

I also developed scripts and a custom CSS stylesheet that generated a curated PDF version of the site. This PDF could be printed and distributed to people both internal to and external to the firm.
