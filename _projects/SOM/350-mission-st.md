I provided the initial Revit training for the team working on the design of this 27 story office tower to be built in downtown San Francisco. In addition, throughout the project I was the primary support contact for the team and provided one on one support when needed. I was also responsible for creating the more advanced Revit families required by the project, and assisted some team members in using Autodesk Navisworks to visualize and coordinate the model.
