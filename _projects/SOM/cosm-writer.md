COSM Writer is a small C# console application I created which reads data from Arduino based sensors and sends the results to one or more [cosm.com](http://www.cosm.com) (now [xively.com](https://xively.com)) data streams. The image below show an Arduino UNO setup with temperature and light sensors.
