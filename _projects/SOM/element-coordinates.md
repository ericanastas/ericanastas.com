This Revit add-in reads the actual XYZ coordinates of families in a Revit model and writes the values back to parameters on the family instances. The values can then be scheduled or shown in tags. For example this can be used with a "Work Point" family for extracting all the coordinates of the work points that define the geometry of a complex project.
