I was responsible for modeling the enclosure of the [Fuzhou Worldwide Tower](http://www.ericanastas.com/category/portfolio/som/projects-som/fwt/) Revit model. I generated the flat faces of the facade using a divided surface populated with a custom adaptive component panel family. However, the panels on the corners of the building form curve, which is not possible to create with standard adaptive curtain panels. So I created a custom 6 point adaptive component panel family, that when placed manually was able to curve around the corner of the building.
