Fill pattern tools is a set of utilities for working with fill patterns within Revit. This includes a tool that can transform existing fill patterns in a Revit model by scaling and/or rotating a selected pattern. In addition, it also includes an export utility for exporting all the fill patterns in a project to a \*.pat file. This is useful when archiving patterns, and transferring patterns between projects.
