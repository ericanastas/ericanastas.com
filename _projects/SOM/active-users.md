The Active Users add-in can be used to identify if any users are working in the current model by checking for borrowed elements. When run a list of the users who currently have elements checked out is displayed along with the number of elements. This is useful when performing maintenance tasks on a model which may invalidate a users local file, or disconnect them from the central file.
