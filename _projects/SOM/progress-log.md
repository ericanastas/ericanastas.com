The Progress Log Revit add-in records a persistent log of the messages displayed in the Revit status bar. Often when trying to diagnose issues with loading, saving, or syncing there will be a status message about a DWG file or something else that Revit may be hung up on. These messages are often are only displayed for a few seconds. The log allows these messages to be reviewed, and saved to an external text file.
