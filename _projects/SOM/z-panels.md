I created this grasshopper definition for the concept design of a new cathedral in Santa Ana California. The definition generates a curved wall out of stacked Z shaped panels which follow the shape of a provided base surface. The length of either leg and the angle of the Z of each panel can be controlled through a list parameter values. These parameter values are repeated across the surface of the wall. Thus by simply changing the list of input values many different variations of patterns of panels could be created.
