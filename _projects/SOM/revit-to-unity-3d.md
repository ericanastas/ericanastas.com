I have been working to develop a workflow to load a Revit model into the [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/) Game engine. Here is a video showing some testing I did of various features of the engine. The primary building geometry in the video was exported from a very complex Revit model, yet Unity was still able to provide excellent performance as shown in the video.
