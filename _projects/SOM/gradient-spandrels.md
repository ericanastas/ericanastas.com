This grasshopper definition, which I created for the 1st & Mission project, generates a building facade system where the height of the window spandrels around each floor vary over their length. The spandrel heights are controlled by a grey scale image that is applied over the building surface. Using a greyscale image as an input like this made it easy for the designers working on the project to try various patterns and gradients without requiring modifications to the original grasshopper definition.
