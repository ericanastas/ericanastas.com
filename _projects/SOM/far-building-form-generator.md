I created this Grasshopper definition for the planning department in my office. It generates a building mass extrusion from a building footprint, a parcel footprint, a floor to floor height, and a desired floor area ratio (FAR). The definition calculates the number of floors required to reach the desired FAR, and generates the resulting building massing geometry. The resulting geometry updates in real time as the input values or boundary shapes are edited.
