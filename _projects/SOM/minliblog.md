MinLibLog is a minimal logging abstraction for .NET Library developers that avoids adding a dependency to any specific logging framework. It is based off [Damian Hickey's LibLog project](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog), but does not require consuming applications to reference any types outside the .NET Framework/.NET Core System namespace.
