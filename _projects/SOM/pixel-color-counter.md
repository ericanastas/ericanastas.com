Pixel Color Counter is a tool I developed to quantify color coded images generated from the Virtual Wind analysis software. It quantifies the area of images that are covered in a specified range of color. A list of image files to analyze in a batch can be specified along with the spectrum of color to quantify. The tool then analysis all the images and generates an Excel report identifying how much of each image falls into the specified range. The tool also has the ability to show colored mask over a preview of each image to help users dial in the correct color range.
