As part of an effort to find a more efficient way for people to create and share drawing redlines I investigated the various digital redlining tools available. However, a common problem I ran into with all the tools I found was that most users were much more comfortable drawing with a pen or pencil then with a mouse. So, I looked into the various interactive pen displays available and found that a very functional "virtual" whiteboard can be created with a Nintendo Wii remote that costs a small fraction of other displays. The video below shows a demo of the virtual whiteboard I was able to setup using two Nintendo Wii remotes, a USB Bluetooth dongle, and a demo copy of [SmoothBoard](http://www.smoothboard.net/). In the video I show how the IR pen can be used to draw in MS Paint, as well mark up a DWF file in Autodesk Design Review.
