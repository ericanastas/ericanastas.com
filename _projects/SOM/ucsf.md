I provided the primary Revit training and support for the UCSF Neuroscience Building project, a 5 story lab building on the UCSF Mission Bay campus. The Revit model was started in the design development phase of the project, and used all the way through construction administration. All construction documents for the project were generated from the Revit model. The model was also used by the general contractor for 3D coordination in NavisWorks.
