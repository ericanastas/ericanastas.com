This grasshopper definition is similar to the [curve paving pattern](http://www.ericanastas.com/curved-paving-pattern/ "Curved Paving Pattern") definition, but instead randomly places blocks from a specified set of available block widths. The size of joints between blocks, the number of courses, and the height of blocks can be controlled with parameter sliders. I also added a colored preview which shows each block size as a different color.
