This grasshopper definition that I created generates a canopy structure built out of folded ribs. The length of each rib, and the location at which they fold can be controlled with curves in the active Rhino model. The video below shows the first version I created which only generates simple line geometry and a lofted surface.

Here is a video of the final version of the definition. In this version I added 3d geometry to the ribs, as well as a fascia surface at the fold point.
