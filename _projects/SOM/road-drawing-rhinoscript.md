Members of the planning department in my office often needed to include roads and sidewalks in their drawings, and were spending a lot of time manually offsetting and filleting road center-lines. I created this RhinoScript to automate this process. The script can automatically offset and fillet road and curb lines from center lines drawn in a Rhino model to a specified offset distance and fillet radius.
