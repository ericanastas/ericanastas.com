SOM Sync is a FTP transfer utility which I developed to facilitate the exchange of files between multiple parties. The specific files to be uploaded or downloaded can be predefined and saved as part of a Sync configuration. Multiple configurations can be setup for different projects, or sets of files that need to be exchanged. This significantly reduces the amount of time spent uploading, and downloading files, and promotes more regular sharing of the models. While the tool can be used to transfer any type of file it is specifically indented for exchanging Navisworks models, as it includes the ability to open these models directly in Navisworks, or the Freedom viewer.
