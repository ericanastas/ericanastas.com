The website for the [Office of the Assessor-Recorder for San Francisco](http://www.sfassessor.org/) provides block and parcel information for the entire city of San Francisco. This website only provides access to a single parcel at a time, where often information for a large area of the city is needed. So I wrote this utility program which [datamines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) the site and generates an excel spreadsheet of all the property information for the range of block and parcel numbers specified.
