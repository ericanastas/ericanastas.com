This grasshopper definition creates a brick wall with varying brick widths and spacings, which results in a varying level of opacity across the surface of the wall. The brick size and thus wall opacity is determined by a grey-scale image. Other parameters such as the maximum brick width, brick height, grout width, and minimum overlap are specified by parameter sliders.
