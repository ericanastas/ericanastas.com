I created this Grasshopper definition that calculates gross building area from building forms modeled in Rhino, or generated in grasshopper. The definition takes any number of building forms as BReps, and a series of floor elevations. The BReps are sections at these elevations and the resulting floor boundary geometry and floor areas are displayed alongside the model. Later I replaced this definition with a set of custom [Building Floors](http://www.ericanastas.com/building-floors/ "Building Floors") components.
