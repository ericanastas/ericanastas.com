This tool generates high resolution aerial images from Google Earth. It was implemented using an HTML webpage which uses JavaScript to manipulates an embedded Google Earth control. The script automatically moves the viewpoint of the control between a grid of seamless positions. A screen shot of each position is taken, and later combined in PhotoShop into one large high resolution image.

I later replaced this tool with [MapStich](/projects/som/mapstitch/), which is fully automated, and downloads the image tiles directly from Google Maps.

Here's an image created of the UCSD campus using this tool. Click the image to expand it, then right click and save as to save to full resolution version.
