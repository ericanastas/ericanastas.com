I created this windows application that generates high resolution satellite images by stitching together image tiles downloaded from [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com). There is no inherent limit on the size of images that can be generated, only the avaible system memory limits what size image is possible.

Here is a sample image of San Francisco generated using MapStich. Click the image to expand it, then right click and save as to save to full resolution (4352 Ã— 3072) file.
