I developed the following Visual Studio project template to easily add unit testing to any Revit API project. This is based off the nUnit testing system previously developed by Steven Downing, Ali Talebi and Yamin Tengono of [ARUP](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/revit-add-in-unit-testing.html). Unit testing allows individual units of a code to be tested in isolation. These tests can be saved and run whenever updates are made to the source code, confirming previous features and assumptions remain valid.
