### Projects

#### Sustainability Data Hub

The Sustainability Data Hub is used to track goals and metrics related to the energy use and carbon footprint of projects across SOM. It provides a platform for teams to enter data about their project and produces aggregate views of this information for management. I developed the front end using Angular, NgRx, and Material Design, working closely with other engineers on the design of the backend REST API.

#### Material Data Hub

Material Data Hub is an in-house catalog of architectural materials that serves as a central hub for SOM designers researching potential products. I developed the frontend interface using React and Material Design (Mui).

#### Collaboration Resource Manager

This application is a general-purpose system to automate the setup and maintenance of SaaS collaboration resources, such as project Google Drives and Groups. Initially built using TypeScript on Google Apps Script, I later ported this to a REST API built on Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. I implemented layers of abstraction to ensure the tool's versatility across various business contexts and resource types.
